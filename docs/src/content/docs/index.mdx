FOlib provides TypeScript type declarations and constants for Fallout 2's SSL scripting engine. It is consumed by [BGforge MLS transpiler](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/VScode-BGforge-MLS) that transpiles TypeScript into Fallout 2's SSL scripting language.

FOlib is a work in progress. Headers are added and/or ported on demand. Contribute on [github](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/folib).

## Entry Points

- **Core** (`folib`) -- vanilla engine builtins: game globals, object/critter/inventory/combat/dialogue functions, branded pointer types.
- **sfall** (`folib/sfall`) -- sfall extension bindings: arrays, hooks, shaders, metarules, helper macros, and game constants.
- **Restoration Project** (`folib/rp/*`) -- game-specific constants for the Fallout 2 Restoration Project: PIDs, scripts, maps, globals.
