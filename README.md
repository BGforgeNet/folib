## FOlib

FOlib provides TypeScript type declarations and constants for TSSL, a TypeScript dialect consumed by [TSSL transpiler](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/VScode-BGforge-MLS/tree/master/transpilers/tssl).

FOlib is a work in progress. Headers are added and/or ported on demand. Contribute on [github](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/folib).

See [documentation](https://folib.bgforge.net) for [setup](https://folib.bgforge.net/setup/) and API reference.
