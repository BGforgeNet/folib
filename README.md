## FOlib

FOlib provides TypeScript type declarations and constants for Fallout 2 SSL. It is consumed by [BGforge MLS transpiler](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/VScode-BGforge-MLS) that converts TypeScript into SSL.

FOlib is a work in progress. Headers are added and/or ported on demand. Contribute on [github](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/folib).
