## FOlib

FOlib provides TypeScript type declarations and constants for Fallout 2's SSL scripting engine. It is consumed by [BGforge MLS transpiler](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/VScode-BGforge-MLS) that transpiles TypeScript into Fallout 2's SSL scripting language.

FOlib is a work in progress. Headers are added and/or ported on demand. Contribute on [github](https://github.com/BGforgeNet/folib).
